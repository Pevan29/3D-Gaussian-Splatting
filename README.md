# 3D-Gaussian-Splatting
## Overview
This is a Colab notebook applying a part of https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting method. Only made to train a first model with minimal requierment, be able to create a PLY file in order to visualize it later in Spline or Super Splat.

## Setup
First, took a video of the scene to process (many angles, point of view). Use FFMPEG to extract 1-2 frames per second of that video. Once
